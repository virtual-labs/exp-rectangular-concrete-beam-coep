# PROCEDURE


## Configuration

- Select the width of supports **w1** and **w2** within the range of **0.23 m to 2 m**.
- Select the **nominal cover** in the range of **20 mm to 70 mm**.
- After setting the parameters, click on the **“Configure”** button.
- Proceed to the next step by clicking the **“Next”** button.

## Calculations

- Calculate **effective cover** and submit your answer. After three incorrect attempts, the formula and correct answer will be displayed.
- Similarly, calculate:
- Effective cover  
- Factored load  
- Effective span  
- Shear force  
- Bending moment  
- Click on **Next Arrow** for the next level after calculation.

## Overall Depth v/s Ast Graph with Calculations

- Calculate the **effective depth** required for a **balanced section**.
- Determine the corresponding **overall depth (D)**.
- Compute the **area of steel (Ast)** for the balanced section.
- Select different values of **total depth (D)** in mm.
- Submit the values and click on the **“Plot Graph”** button to observe the **D v/s Ast graph**.
- Repeat this for a **minimum of 4 readings**.
- Click the **“Next”** arrow to continue.

## Calculation of Reinforcement Bars

- Select the provided **total depth value (D)**; the **effective depth** and **Ast** will be calculated.
- Select **bar diameter** and calculate the **number of bars required**.
- Trials can be taken by changing the bar diameter and observing the changes.
- After the trials, click on the **"Next"** arrow for the next level.

## Calculation for Shear Force at Critical Section

- Calculate **shear force** at the critical section.
- Calculate **shear stress** at the critical section.
- Compute **design shear strength of concrete**.
- Calculate **maximum shear strength**.
- Provide **2-legged stirrups** and select the **grade of steel for stirrups**. **Spacing** will be obtained.

## Economical

- Select the **grade of steel for longitudinal reinforcement**, enter its **cost per kg**, and then click on **"Submit"**.
- Select the **grade of steel for stirrups**, enter its **cost per kg**, and click on **"Submit"**.
- Select the **grade of concrete**, enter its **cost per kg**, and click on **"Submit"**.
- Observe the **cost for different values of D**.
