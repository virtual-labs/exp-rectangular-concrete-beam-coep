### Configuration :
- Configure the parameters to Design a singly reinforced beam
- Width of support w1 and w2 ranges between 0.23 to 2 (m). Also nomial cover ranges between 20 to 70 (mm) 
- Click the "Configure" button, then click the "Next" arrow to proceed to the next level 

### Calculations :
- Calculate effective cover and submit your answer. After three incorrect attempts, the formula and correct answer will be provided 
- Similarly calculate effective cover, factored load, effective span, shear force and bending moment 
- Click on Next Arrow for next level after calculation.

### OverAll Depth Vs ASt Graph with Calculations :

- Calculate the required effective depth for a balanced section and provide the overall depth (D). Similarly, calculate the AST for the balanced section
- Select different values of total depth (D) in mm, submit them, then click the 'Plot Graph' button to observe the graph
- Repeat for minimum 4 readings and click on "Next" arrow  


### Rein Bars Calculate
- Select the provided total depth value (D); the effective depth and Ast will be calculated
- Select bar diameter and calculate number of bars required . Trials can be taken by changing bar diameter and observe the changes
- After Trials click on "Next" arrow  for next level


### Calculation for shear force for critical section: 
- Calculate shear force at critical section
- Calculate shear stress at critical section 
- Design Shear strength of concrete
- Calculate Maximum shear strength
- Provide 2 legged stirrups and select Grade of steel for stirrups you will get the spacing


### Economical:
- Select the garde of steel for longitudinal reinforcement and enter its cost per kg, click on "Submit"
- Select the garde of steel for longitudinal stirrup enter its cost per kg, click on "Submit"
- Select the garde of concrete enter its cost per kg, click on "Submit"
- Observe the cost for different values of D.
