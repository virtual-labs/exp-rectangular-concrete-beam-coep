### Configuration :
- Configure the parameters to Design a singly reinforced beam. 
- Width of support w1 and w2 ranges between 0.23 to 2 (m). Also nomial cover ranges between 20 to 70 (mm). 
-  Click on Next Arrow button after selecting all the values. 

### Calculations : 
- Calculate effective cover, factored load, effective span, shear force and bending moment.
-  Click on Next Arrow for next level after calculation.

### OverAll Depth Vs ASt Graph with Calculations :
- Required effective depth for balanced section , Provide Overall depth (D) this is to be calculated. Calculate AST for balanced section. 
- Select Provided depth (D) and submit. click on plot graph button and observe the changes in the graph. Repeat this step for more readings.

### Rein Bars Calculate
- Select provided total depth value (D), so that effective depth and Ast will be calculated. 
- Select bar diameter and calculate number of bars required . Trials can be taken by changing bar diameter and observe the changes.
- After Trials click on next arrow for next level.


### Calculation for shear force for critical section: 
- Calculate shear force at critical section.
- Calculate shear stress at critical section .
- Design Shear strength of concrete.
- Calculate Maximum shear strength.
- Provide 2 legged stirrups and select Grade of steel for stirrups you will get the spacing.
